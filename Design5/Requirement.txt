Requirements:

1.) Must use CSS Grid, but you can use CSS Flexbox for the navbar (if you want).

2.) Try to add an animation of some sort. (google how to do animations with css and just add a simple one, doesn't need to be complex. There is a specific css property for animations)

Notes:
- pay attention to padding and margins. Try to get them as close to the design as possible.
- sometimes you can go to codepen to check out how other people designed a thing you're trying to design.
